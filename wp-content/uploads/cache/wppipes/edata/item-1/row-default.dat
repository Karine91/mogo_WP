&nbsp;<br>
Some of you may have wondered why I only published one post this week. The answer is simply: I just did not have the time to do more. While I started writing a number of texts, I was not satisfied enough with either of them, and some thoughts seem to be somehow stuck inside me at the moment. The only text that passed my internal quality control was the one I posted about getting old. I realize more and more that I can&rsquo;t keep digging up personal posts and publishing them, always new and on schedule. On the other hand, I am also not satisfied with posting three or four pics with two lines of text. So I guess I&rsquo;m looking for the right balance again.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
That said, I will have a bunch of new fashion tips for you next week, plus the coolest shirts, and &ndash; hopefully &ndash; another personal post. In fact, I already know what it&rsquo;ll be about ;)</span></p>

You read the text and it resonates, you think &lsquo;Yes! Makes perfect sense!&rsquo;. All in all a good article about the fashion of the near future.</span></p>

I feel this account paints a pretty accurate picture of our capital, the charm and interaction of Berliners with each other, somehow between toughness and love.</span></p>

I talk about my past, show a vulnerable side by telling you some examples of hurtful experiences during the years of blogging. I also share how I learned to stay true to myself. And there&rsquo;s more. Lisa and I gossip about some celebrities, devise a theory and answer a couple of great questions from listeners. All in all it&rsquo;s a pretty emotional episode. </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 420px; margin-left: 620px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Abril Fatface', display; font-size: 24pt;">Heard (Read):</span><br><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'EB Garamond', serif;">Not long ago I finished the &lsquo;Lightbringer&rsquo; series by Brent Weeks, and I was so sad about having come to the end of this 5 book saga that I decided to continue straight with the Night Angel Trilogy. I just wanted to stay immersed in that world.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I have a huge thing for fantasy novels right now. Fantasy and everything else that takes me to a different place with an altered reality, really. I guess I am now in Fantasy phase, after having come out of a prolonged sci-fi phase before. If there&rsquo;s magic, I&rsquo;m in. Thing is, I only just started but I&rsquo;m already through with the Night Angel Trilogy. I felt the plot lagged a bit in the middle, but the story has really picked up speed again in part three, and the finale is truly breathless and leaves nothing to be desired. I often feel quite underwhelmed by the endings of books, but not with this one, this one was perfect. It&rsquo;s somehow comforting to see a story wrapped up in style. Still, I need more.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I guess I&rsquo;ll go for at least one more phantasy cycle and may then switch to historical novels &ndash; which will probably be my next literary phase.</span></p>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Abril Fatface', display; font-size: 24pt;">the experiment:</span><br><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'EB Garamond', serif;">When Grazia asked me whether I&rsquo;d be up for an experiment, I didn&rsquo;t hesitate to jump in. The premise sounded too good to pass on it: Going offline for 48 hours. Offline &ndash; for reals.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
It must be more than 10 years that I have been offline for that long, and to be honest I barely remember my life prior to social media, it is such an integral part of me. On the one hand I am really looking forward to the experiment and am very excited about it, on the other hand I am also a little scared. No Google maps, no music, no e-mails. So often do I think about how our permanent access to the net changes us, but hardly ever has the thought to go offline myself crossed my mind. 48 hours may not be that much, but I am really looking forward to the experience.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The story of the experiment will be published in an upcoming issue of Grazia in about tow or three weeks, an I will publish it here on my blog shortly thereafter. I am super curious and very excited about it!</span></p>
