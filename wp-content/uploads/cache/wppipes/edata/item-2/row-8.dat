It happens quite frequently these days. It was one of those days where all I wanted to do was to hide and forget all about my life. Somehow I felt like a complete loser. I know that it&rsquo;s not a big deal and that everyone feels like that from time to time, but it was a really dark hole I fell into yesterday. My way of dealing with it was to share how I felt with you on Instastories. I mean, that&rsquo;s the problem, isn&rsquo;t it?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Everything always looks so amazing on social media, everyone seems happy&hellip; but what to do when you don&rsquo;t feel happy, when life doesn&rsquo;t feel beautiful? I often feel like that, and I usually get the impression I am completely alone with these emotions. </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: -250px; margin-left: 550px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'EB Garamond', serif; color: #000000;">Well, pretty much straight away I got a disrespectful comment along the lines of &lsquo;You look like a ghost without makeup and lipstick. I&rsquo;m going to have to unfollow you. Do your followers a favor and always remember to put on make-up.&rsquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br><em>So far, so shit.</em><br>
&nbsp;<br>
But then came your reaction, and I was so touched by it that it brought tears to my eyes. I received sooo many lovely messages and encouragement from you. Many of you were as speechless as I was that a man would be capable of saying such a thing to a woman.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I want to tell you that I am so very thankful for your love and comments. Every single one of them made me smile! I really don&rsquo;t know how to adequately express my gratitude. You are wonderful. THANK YOU! I simply cannot express how much the love you send my way every day means to me!</span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.masha-sedgwick.com/de/22-wochenrueckblick/blumen-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-52684"><img class="alignright wp-image-52684" style="margin-top: 150px; margin-right: 50px; border: 1px solid #cdcad1;" src="http://www.masha-sedgwick.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/blumen-4.jpg" alt="Blumen / Pfingstrosen" width="350" height="599"></a></p>
<p style="margin-right: 600px; text-align: justify; margin-top: 300px;"><span style="font-family: 'EB Garamond', serif; color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 36pt;">D</span>I was in Milan this week, which meant &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; a bit of dolce vita for yours truly. Not too much though, sadly, my trip was quite a brief one. I love Italy and always enjoy wandering through  beautiful Italian alleys. Could have easily stayed a bit longer, even though the entire trip was packed with work, meetings and refreshing my make-up.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But I had an awesome reason for the trip down south: Armani is launching a new fragrance, and invited me to Milan. Where else, right?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 500px; margin-top: -240px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'EB Garamond', serif; color: #000000;">Armani is everywhere in this city &ndash; Armani Hotel, Armani Caf&eacute;, Armani Museum, Armani Theater, Armani whatnot. A new fragrance seems like a natural addition, especially since this scent was created to symbolize a perfect couple. But more on that later.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
So, while those were busy days, the rest of the week was more quiet, which meant I had a chance to work off some items on my to do list. I already ticked one of those boxes the day before yesterday by posting <a href="http://www.masha-sedgwick.com/travel-guide-11-things-to-do-in-taiwan/" target="_blank">part one of my comprehensive Taiwan guide</a>. Next week I&rsquo;ll hopefully have part two for you! </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'Dawning of a New Day', handwriting; font-size: 36pt; color: #000000;">And before I forget: Happy Pentecost everyone!</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 50px; margin-right: 550px; text-align: justify; border-top: 1px solid #cdcad1; padding: 1em;"><span style="font-family: 'EB Garamond', serif; color: #000000;">My little trip to Italy also took me to Florence, where I had the honor to meet the founder of <a href="http://bit.ly/2s67J5J" target="_blank">Luisaviaroma</a> for lunch. It was of course incredibly interesting to meet such a personality from the fashion industry, and to get to glimpse behind the curtain of such a major company. At these occasions I always hope I can take something with me &ndash; I think I really could with this one.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The thing is, I sometimes ask myself what real leadership quality is at the heart of it. I believe that on top of many other qualities a certain hardness is necessary. I could also call it a certain distance. Well, with that in mind it was beautiful to see that the man behind this large company is not a  hardened human being. On the contrary, he can be soft as butter, especially when it comes to La Famiglia. Unlike many other large companies, Luisaviaroma is a real family enterprise. What started out as an inherited hat store (called Luisa on Via Roma) is now a luxury company run jointly by several generations. </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: -430px; margin-left: 550px; margin-bottom: 100px; text-align: justify; border-top: 1px solid #cdcad1; padding: 1em;"><span style="font-family: 'EB Garamond', serif; color: #000000;">Talking to the founder I asked him about his values in life, and the reply was that family, health and quality are the most important things for him.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And you know how it is, the best quality is not always the most fancy &ndash; as exemplified by the restaurant we had lunch in, which was a tiny place at the end of a little street. A regular everyday place, where he has eaten lunch for the past 20 years. The restaurant looked more like a little living room, with a kitchen that looks exactly like it did 50 years ago. They don&rsquo;t even have a fridge, everything is bought fresh. All these little details just add to the charm of the place.<br>
&nbsp;<br><em>&lsquo;Why do you come here, of all places?&rsquo;</em> I asked him.<br><em>&lsquo;Because the food has been good for 20 years straight&rsquo;.</em><br>
And then we drank to the future.<br>
&nbsp;<br><strong>I have a feeling I will be back in Florence before too long.</strong> </span></p>

&nbsp;<br>
As some of you know already, I am a huge fan of epic fantasy stories, and always on the lookout for a new universe I can immerse myself in. The Light Saga was a great find, it describes a world in which magic and light are connected. It&rsquo;s maybe a bit like an Arab version of Harry Potter, in as much as the plot is centered on a specific location, and the protagonist is a young student who is still in school. If you love corny hero stories with surprising plot twists, and if you don&rsquo;t mind stories that sprawl out over several books, then look no further than the Light Saga. I, for my part, cannot wait for the next part!!</span></p></div>";s:6:"author";O:16:"SimplePie_Author":3:{s:4:"name";s:5:"Masha";s:4:"link";N;s:5:"email";N;}s:4:"date";s:19:"2017-06-03 07:23:04";s:10:"enclosures";a:1:{i:0;O:19:"SimplePie_Enclosure":27:{s:7:"bitrate";N;s:8:"captions";N;s:10:"categories";N;s:8:"channels";N;s:9:"copyright";N;s:7:"credits";N;s:11:"description";N;s:8:"duration";N;s:10:"expression";N;s:9:"framerate";N;s:7:"handler";N;s:6:"hashes";N;s:6:"height";N;s:10:"javascript";N;s:8:"keywords";N;s:4:"lang";N;s:6:"length";N;s:4:"link";N;s:6:"medium";N;s:6:"player";N;s:7:"ratings";N;s:12:"restrictions";a:1:{i:0;O:21:"SimplePie_Restriction":3:{s:12:"relationship";s:5:"allow";s:4:"type";N;s:5:"value";s:7:"default";}}s:12:"samplingrate";N;s:10:"thumbnails";N;s:5:"title";N;s:4:"type";N;s:5:"width";N;}}s:7:"src_url";s:47:"http://www.masha-sedgwick.com/22-weekly-update/";s:8:"src_name";s:17:"22.
